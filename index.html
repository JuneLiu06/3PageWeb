        <h1>Ocean Pollution</h1>
        <p>The ocean, covering over 70% of our planet, is vital for our survival. It regulates our climate, provides food, and is a primary source of biodiversity. Yet, the health of our vast oceans is under unprecedented threat due to human activities. From massive floating garbage patches to declining marine populations, the signs of distress are evident. Ocean pollution not only affects marine life but also impacts human health and our economy. In this website, we will explore the causes of ocean pollution, its dire consequences, and the potential solutions we can adopt to address this growing problem.</p>
