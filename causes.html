     <p>Plastic Waste: Millions of tons of plastic enter the oceans each year. These plastics break down into microplastics which are ingested by marine animals, affecting the food chain.</p>
    <p>Industrial Runoff: Factories and industrial plants often discharge untreated chemicals and waste into the oceans, leading to toxin accumulation.</p>
    <p>Oil Spills: Large oil spills from tanker ships are disastrous for marine ecosystems, covering marine life in toxic oil and depleting oxygen levels.</p>
    <p>Agricultural Runoff: Pesticides, fertilizers, and other chemicals used in farming flow into the oceans through rivers, leading to 'dead zones' where nothing can survive.</p>
    <p>Marine Transport: Shipping activities result in the release of toxic substances, garbage disposal, and noise pollution that disrupt marine life.</p>
